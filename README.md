# CIFLE: cycle-informed fatigue-life estimation

# Project overview
CIFLE consists of three modules that work in sequence
M1: synthesizes representative hysteresis loops from basic LCF inputs
M2: extracts physically interpretable fatigue parameters from each loop
M3: predicts the fatigue life fraction and its uncertainty from these parameters

This repository provides Python source code configuration files
A public .csv with M2 features for M3 training is provided
